            <!-- True love transcends language and is not bound to the constructs of
            our reality. True love is unconditional not dependent upon
            circumstances or time. But rather it is a state of being in the
            soul- nurtured and cultivated by the creator. True love is when you
            look inside one's eyes and feel your souls were meant to collide.
            True love is filled with passion and grace for another's mistake.
            True love is like an ocean that has many depths to be explored. And,
            the beauty in it is worth more than what can be seen from shore.
          </p>
          <p class="letter__body">
            True love is enamored with anothers being mind, body, and spirit. It
            is cultivated by one's presence and inspired by one's intellect.
            True love is illuminating. It has the power to shine so bright it
            lights the dimmest part of one's heart.
          </p>
          <p class="letter__body">
            If you are so fortunate to find true love, you will be in awe at the
            millions of ways it engulfs your soul. True love has the ability to
            be the embodiment of everything that feels right to you. True love
            is understanding beyond what words can utter. And, true love not
            only sees you for who you are, but for all you can be. True love may
            not be perfect, but true love is everything and all you need.
